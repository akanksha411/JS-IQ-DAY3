    <h2>Interview Preparation JS Day 3</h2>
    <h3>1. How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->A operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand
                i)Arithmatic operator: +,-,/,%,*
               ii)Comparison: ==,===,>,<
              iii)logical: &&,||,!
              iv)Assignment:  +=, -=
                v)Ternary:  ?:
               vi)Spread: ...
    </pre>
    <h3>2.What are arrow functions?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> Arrow function is introduced in ES6 version of JS. It is also known as fat arrow function.
            It uses => operator to define the function and eliminate the function keyword.They are also called anonymous function.
                    Example:
                        let sum=(a,b)=>{return a+b}
                        console.log(sum(5,7));        
    </pre>
    <h3>3.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> Undefined--> Undefined is a value which indicates a variable has been declared but not initialized 
                    let x;
                    console.log(x);    
            Not defined--> Not defined occurs when the variable is not declared but we trying to aceess.
                    console.log(y);
            NAN-->NAN is a special value that indicates an operation that was expected to return a number, has resulted an error. It can be cause by any operation which is not possible.
                    console.log(Number("hello"))               
    </pre>
    <h3>4.What is callback hell</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->Callback hell happens when we nest multiple callback within a function. The shape of resulting structure resembles a pyramid.
                Example        
                setTimeout(()=>{
                    console.log(1)
                    setTimeout(()=>{
                        console.log(2)
                    },2000)
                },1000)
    </pre>
    <h3>5.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> A self invoking function is also known as Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE, that is defined and immediately called without requiring a separate function call.
                Example
                    (function(){
                        let x='hello';
                        console.log(x);
                    }) ()
    </pre>
    <h3>6. What is the use of setTimeout</h3>
    <pre>
Ans--> setTimeout is a JS function which allows you to execute a function with a specific delay.
                Example
                        setTimeout(()=>{
                            console.log('This is a example of setTimeout which will be executed after 1000ms(or 1sec'))
                        },1000)        
    </pre>
